    "description": "<p>The body of work titled \"Brother\" represents a continuation of a previous project centered around my nuclear family. Captured primarily in my childhood home in the town of Shoham, the photographs were taken at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the initial lockdowns. Reflecting on this period, I turned my focus to my younger brother, delving into the nuances of our relationship.</p><p>Over several meetings in various locations, we spent hours together engaging in deep conversations and exploring our surroundings. This journey was driven by an existential thread that weaves through my connection with Ori.</p><p>The series is shot in black and white, using two analog cameras: a 35 mm and a 6x6.</p>",
