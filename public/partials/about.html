    <p id="about-description">
        Zornitser's research investigates themes of transience and liminality, with a particular emphasis on individuals
        emerging from local queer and underground scenes who challenge social norms. Their work examines spaces
        associated with underground culture, utilizing an analog large-format camera. Zornitser enhances the visual
        portrayal of transformative experiences by applying hormone liquids—originally prescribed for their
        gender-affirming therapy—to chromogenic printing papers, integrating their body into the work and fostering a
        dialogue between the medium and their themes of research.
