    <p id="about-description">
        Zornitser's research investigates themes of transience and liminality, with a particular emphasis on individuals
        emerging from local queer and underground scenes who challenge social norms. Their work examines spaces
        associated with queer culture, utilizing an analog large-format camera. By applying hormone liquids to
        chromogenic printing papers, Zornitser enhances the visual representation of transformative experiences,
        creating a dialogue between the medium and the subject.
